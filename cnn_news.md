Peter Humphrey was once locked up in China. Now he advises other prisoners and their families how to take on Beijing

When they brought him his passport, Jeff Harper thought he was getting out. 

He stared at the document, its navy cover embossed with the United States seal, as it gradually dawned on him that the Chinese police officer, in his broken English, was describing something quite different.
"He said something about a residential surveillance house," Harper said. "I had no idea what that was."

A police document seen by CNN, dated January 20, said Harper was being investigated for causing serious injury by negligence. Harper did not dispute that he had pushed the man but said he did not appear to be seriously injured when he left the scene of the original incident.

当他们给他带护照时，杰夫·哈珀以为他要出去了。
他盯着那份印着美国印章的海军封面的文件，渐渐意识到，这位中国警官用蹩脚的英语描述着完全不同的情况。
“他说了一些关于监视住宅的事情，”哈珀说我不知道那是什么。”
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）1月20日看到的一份警方文件说，哈珀因疏忽造成严重伤害正在接受调查。哈珀没有否认他推搡了这名男子，但说他离开原事件现场时似乎没有受重伤。
